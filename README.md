# Git & GitHub Fundamentals – DevOps Internship Task

## Objective
The objective of this task is to understand and practice core Git and GitHub operations used in real-world DevOps workflows, including version control, branching, merging, and rollback.

---

## Tools & Environment
- Git (installed locally)
- Git Bash (Windows)
- GitHub (remote repository hosting)
- OS: Windows

---

## Task Execution Steps

### 1. Git Installation & Configuration
- Installed Git on the local system
- Configured global username and email using:
  - `git config --global user.name`
  - `git config --global user.email`

---

### 2. Local Repository Initialization
- Created a project directory
- Initialized Git repository using `git init`
- Verified `.git` directory creation

---

### 3. File Creation & Version Tracking
- Created multiple files (`file1.txt`, `file2.txt`)
- Checked repository status using `git status`
- Staged files using `git add`
- Created commits using `git commit`

---

### 4. GitHub Repository Integration
- Created a new GitHub repository
- Linked local repository to GitHub using HTTPS
- Verified remote connection using `git remote -v`

---

### 5. Pushing Code to Remote Repository
- Pushed local commits to GitHub using `git push`
- Verified successful push and branch tracking

---

### 6. Branching & Merging
- Created a new feature branch using `git checkout -b`
- Made changes in the feature branch and committed them
- Switched back to main branch
- Merged feature branch into main using `git merge`

---

### 7. Rollback & History Management
- Viewed commit history using `git log`
- Practiced safe rollback using `git checkout`
- Demonstrated rollback behavior using `git reset`
- Re-committed changes after reset

---

## Final Outcome
- Gained hands-on experience with Git version control
- Understood real-world Git workflows used in DevOps teams
- Successfully managed code changes, branches, merges, and rollbacks
- Pushed and maintained project history on GitHub
